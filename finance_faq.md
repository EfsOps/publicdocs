## <a id="zuora">Zuora FAQ</a>

### Why did Zuora produce this error for a Credit Card transaction: `Error: Transaction declined.12 - Declined: 15005-This transaction cannot be processed`<a id="zuoracc"></a>

This is caused by the Credit Cardâ€™s issuing bank. It is generally due to a limit on the card. **The partner will need to contact their credit card provider** and ask the limit to be increased or for eFolder Inc. to be added to their whitelist for purchases.
